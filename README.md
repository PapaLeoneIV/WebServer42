# 42 Web Server  
A lightweight HTTP server built in **C++98** as part of the **42 curriculum**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

The main objectives of this project were:

- âœ… Parse a configuration file to handle routing and behavior  
- âœ… Support multiple connections using `select()`  
- âœ… Implement basic HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`  
- âœ… Handle CGI requests (e.g., `.sh`, `.py` scripts)

---

## ðŸ§© Components Overview

### ðŸ§¾ ConfigParser

- Parses a custom configuration file using a **stack** and a **tree** structure.  
- The **stack** helps manage nesting levels of `server` and `location` blocks.  
- The **tree** represents the hierarchical relationship between these blocks for efficient traversal.

---

### ðŸ–§ ServerManager

Responsible for managing active servers and client connections.

Main responsibilities include:

- `RegisterConnection()` â€” Accept and register new client connections  
- `ProcessRequest()` â€” Read and parse client requests  
- `SendResponse()` â€” Construct and send HTTP responses

---

### ðŸ“¬ RequestParser

A **state machine** that incrementally parses HTTP requests **one character at a time**, following the official RFC 3986 specification.

This design ensures support for partial reads and pipelined requests.

---

### ðŸ“¦ ResourceParser

Uses the parsed configuration to determine whether a requested resource is valid and accessible.  
If not, it prepares an appropriate HTTP error response (e.g., `404`, `403`, etc.).
